    "description": "This vertical print shows the silhouette of a person standing in a doorway, gazing out of a window. The man appears to be dressed in formal attire from a historical period, with a coat and what looks like a high collar or cravat. He wears a white wig. He stands with his hands behind his back in a contemplative pose. The room contains elegant details, including parts of a decorative frame and a small linen-covered table on the left, and a curtain pulled to one side of the window on the right. Through the lower window panes, there appears to be tree foliage visible. The image has a sepia-toned, vintage appearance. Under the image line, on both sides is a small text identifying the artist on the left, and the publisher on the right. At the center of the bottom margin is the title of the work in capital letters \"FELIX GRUNDY\". Other smaller text appears beneath it."

    "description": "This vertical print is a head and shoulders portrait of a middle-aged woman against a black background. Her head is tilted slightly downward, her long hair combed back from her forehead. She wears a dark dress and a dark blue shawl over her shoulders. Dramatic shadows across the woman's face, downcast eyes, and prominent cheekbones suggest the person's physical suffering."

    "description": "This vertical painting depicts a young woman in a white, draped dress seated by a terrace wall with a view of the green outdoors. The woman wears her hair in an upswept style, her white dress falls in soft, loose folds around her body. She sits on a dark, curved chair, barefoot, with one leg slightly drawn. She holds a ball of blue yarn in her left hand. A winged child-like naked figure stands on the low terrace wall, leans behind the woman, and anoints her ear. She looks up sideways as if towards where she feels the touch, her eyes wide open and lips formed in a soft smile, showing her white teeth. There is a conical woven basket beside her on a tiled floor with several balls of blue yarn, and diagonally across stands a wooden loom with the same color yarn woven through it. A white column rises in the background along the right margin of the picture."

    "description": "This vertical print depicts an elderly Black woman in a bright home setting. She wears a polka-dotted dress with red, mint green, and brown circles. The woman sits next to a small table against a vivid red wall or background, her feet in simple, brown, laced shoes touching a light green floor. Her face looks tired, with a tightly closed mouth and multiple wrinkles that seem accentuated in black on her resting arms as well. On the three-legged table sits a mint green pot containing a flowering plant painted with black stems and small white blooms. The foreground is divided into a mint green floor and a narrower purple-gray baseboard, creating a striking contrast with the red wall. There is an artist's signature and date in the upper right corner."

    "description": "This watercolor is the artist's self-portrait, a head-on view of a dark-skinned man filling the vertical sheet of paper where the top of his head and both ears are omitted. The face is rendered predominantly in shades of black and gray and painted in small blotches as a stitched quilt would be sewn together. The eyes are dark with white highlights, set beneath what looks like eyebrows created by darker patches. The darker areas define the nose, mouth, and facial structure, while lighter areas highlight portions of the forehead, cheeks, and chin. The image is set against a light tan or beige background. At the bottom edge, there's a burgundy or reddish-brown color that might represent clothing below the neck. A vertical line is running down the center of the image, suggesting a folded page."

    "description": "This vertical print, done in an etching technique, depicts two young women seated together by an interior wall. On the left sits a woman with dark, voluminous hair styled in a distinctive tall headdress. She wears elaborate clothing with a decorative bodice and flowing sleeves, and her bare feet are visible at the bottom of her dress. On the floor to her left sits another woman with darker features. She appears to be leaning against the festive-dressed woman. She wears a simple head covering, a simple skirted dress, and slippers. There is a patterned rug on the floor, and in the lower part of the print, partially obscured, stands a small decorated wooden stool with a spherical object looking like an apple. The interior wall is covered up to two-thirds of its height by what looks like a textured textile. There is a small wall opening (or a closed window) to the upper right of the image for keeping a few objects. A candlestick holder and another unidentified pouch-like object hang on each side of the opening. The artist's signature and date are handwritten in the upper left corner."

    "description": "The portrait of a Black person fills almost entirely this black and white rectangular photograph. They face forward, their eyes partly closed. Their skin appears to have a dark, matte finish. The facial features are softly defined against the stark light background. They wear a tall, conical headdress that rises vertically from their head, wrapped in dark, furry fabric. A decorative element with what appears to be a small round pendant with a tassel hangs at the front of the headdress. The person's neck and shoulders are completely encircled by a thick, textured collar with a distinctive pattern featuring dark spots or swirling shapes. This patterned material forms a circular support around her neck and upper chest."

    "description": "This horizontal black and white photograph diptych consists of two rectangular panels side by side. The left panel shows a white plate against a black background, with text reading \"NOT GOOD ENOUGH\" printed in the middle of it. The right panel shows a portion of a Black woman's body, with a fragment of white, scalloped-edged clothing visible. Only the woman's lips and chin are visible, and the words \"BUT GOOD ENOUGH TO SERVE\" are printed between her collarbones. The panels are set within a light gray border or frame surrounding the entire image."
