    "description": "Taken from a slanted perspective, this horizontal grayscale image depicts the midst of a football game between the longstanding rivals of the University of Texas at Austin in darker jerseys and Oklahoma University in white jerseys at the Cotton Bowl. The field is strewn with players from both sides, but one in a white jersey in the center is carrying a football in mid-stride near the sideline in an attempt to score. At the foreground of the print, at the edge of the field facing the players, is a referee in the signature black and white pinstripe shirt with white pants and black socks scanning the field to assess the play. The backdrop of this picture has thousands of fans in the stadium seating presumably cheering for their respective teams. The clouds loom in the distance, above the audience."

    "description": "This print depicts a baseball game from the perspective of a person in the stands, watching the game from a high angle facing toward the right. Red steel poles protruding from the stands hold up the layer of mesh that covers the front of the stands and stretches over the top. The third base marker, as well as the left side of the stands, is cut off by the left side of the print. The stadium is tightly packed with fans wearing either hats or carrying parasols, presumably to block the sunlight in the outdoor stadium. The background of the print photo shows the scoreboard and rolling hills peaking over the top of the stands, as well as a light brown, dome-shaped building in the distance. Three large, yellow spherical balloons float above the stands. The field has cream colored sand with vibrant green grass encircling it. The athletes, drawn as small stick figures with no discernible features, are all dressed in white in their respective positions in the outfield or infield. There is a batter in the box which signifies that there is an incoming pitch at the moment this setting was created."

    "description": "This painting focuses on red-crowned cranes in the autumn landscape. In its foreground on the lower right lie the feet of hills topped by mosses and grasses in cyan and blue colors. Two clusters of Amur silvergrass (Miscanthus sacchariflorus) grow by the river. On the rocks stand erect three maple trees dotted with red leaves. Besides the maples and silvergrass clusters are five red-crowned cranes standing in the lower middle part of the painting. While two are looking for food in the grasses, another crane is probably chirping with its beak open upwards. Represented by indistinguishable horizontal lines, the river flows through the middle ground of the painting diagonally, blending in with the sky. Further to the background which is on the left, a crane has just taken off from the rocks beneath. The inscriptions in the upper left corner point out the four main themes of this painting: maple, silvergrass, crane, chirping, and frost."

    "description": "This work depicts the lone figure of a woman who is holding up a large harp with a single broken string. The woman is wearing a red petal-layered dress that covers her whole body, with the exception of her head and her arms. The petal layers grow larger as they get closer to the bottom hem. Black feather bracelets and collar decorate her wrists and neck. Her light-colored hair falls behind her shoulders and two tall red feathers are tucked behind her ear, drooping over the top of her head. The woman is facing the viewer, but her body is angled towards the right side, with the harp clutched between her arms. Her expression shows half-lidded eyes, slanted eyebrows, and tightly closed lips, with a beauty mark resting above the right corner. The harp, taller than the woman, is decorated with flower patterns and has a red tinge. The woman holds the harp's single broken cord in her right hand."

    "description": "This black and white photograph depicts a woman sitting behind a stand with a wooden table. The photo is taken from the front of the stand, showing the dry earth the table is resting on and the natural landscape in the background. The table has items and small box cases on display, with glass spheres and flower-shaped charms suspended above them. The table reaches the seated woman's waist. She is sitting on a chair with her face and body turned to the right, hands on her lap, and smiling with teeth. She has dark long hair and dark-toned skin and is wearing a patterned, sequined dress that extends from her neck to her calves, along with strapped sandals. Behind the woman, the background of the photo shows a landscape, with a field with tall grasses directly behind her and mountains far in the distance."

    "description": "This black and white photograph depicts an elderly man and a large van, separated by metal fencing. The man is positioned along the bottom center of the photograph, in front of the metal bars, while the van is parked behind the fence, taking up the bottom half of the man's background. The elderly man faces the left side of the photograph. He is wearing a collared long-sleeved shirt, a vest, and a hat that casts a shadow over his eyes. Behind him, on the bottom-right corner of the photograph, a small sign is propped up against a tire and states \"no cash refund.\" Behind the metal bars, the empty van looms over the man while a flag, decorated with a lion, flaps beside it. The faded silhouette of a mountain can be seen in the far distance, above the van."

    "description": "The white glazed porcelain vase with a central neck is hand-painted from its base up to the top flare around its circumference. In front view of the vase are four women and three boys dressed in variable combinations of green-blue, red, yellow, and pink robes. One of the women sits on a stool by a desk, holding a book (can't tell what it is) in her left hand. She seems to be talking to the two boys standing in front of the desk. There is a pink, blooming lotus flower beside her feet. While the three standing women gather their attention on the sitting woman, evidenced by their tilted heads and the pointing index finger, the three young boys are captured focus by the colorful insects flying in the back of the vase. In the background stand two Hardy Banana Plants (Musa basjoo) with long, green leaves and red blossoms."

    "description": "This painting depicts the full figure of a stag standing on a grassy field among shrubs with blue flowers. The stag is facing left, head held up high. Its neck is decorated with a necklace of leaves and its antlers are adorned with small purple flowers. The stag's light brown coat is shaded darkly along its back, front legs, and forehead, reflecting the shadows cast by the dark night. Specks of starlight are scattered across the dark blue sky in the background."

    "description": "This photograph shows a golden hourglass with legs. The standing figure takes up the left half of the photograph. The hourglass has flat circular bases on the top and bottom, with three supporting columns between them. Although a small mound of white sand is forming on the bottom half of the hourglass, most of the sand remains on the top half. Two smooth white legs, facing the right side of the photograph, sprout from the bottom base. The legs cast two thin shadows on the pale surface that the figure is standing on. The background, taking up the top half of the photograph, is dark and indiscernible, contrasting with the pale bottom half."

    "description": "This black and white photograph shows an elderly woman sitting in a parking lot with various objects displayed in front of her. The woman is wearing a collared, light-colored sweater and a long checker-patterned skirt. She is seated upon a chair, legs crossed, a long-haired doll spread across her lap. Her head is bent down while she tinkers with the doll, making only the top of her hat visible. Beside her, on the right side of the photograph, a car has its trunk wide open, showing the dolls, boxes, and parcels swathed in cloth that are placed inside. Two tall baby dolls dressed in drilled dresses and bonnets are leaning on the edge of the car. In front of the woman, laid on top of a blanket, paper bags, baby dolls, figurines, and other small children's toys are on display. The background is filled with other parked vehicles."
