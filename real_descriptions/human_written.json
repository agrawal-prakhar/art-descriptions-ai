    "description": "This print captures a water landscape with water plants known as spatterdock. The plant has round, heart-shaped floating leaves scattered around the image. The leaves are dark and light green. One decaying leaf is spotted on the side of the bird, which is the focal point of the image. Small yellow flowers and buds can be seen. The artist also depicts the plant roots in the water. The water is shaded in a brownish clay color. The artist renders the surface of the water with floating leaves and its depth with the plant roots. In the foreground, a bird called snipe is flying with its wings outspread. The water surface reflects the bird's flying shadow. The artist details the intricate feathers with a palette of black, brown, and beige colors accented with white lines. The heavy detailed bird stands out against the abstract descriptions of plants."

    "description": "In the center of the work, a woman sits atop a wooden surface. The woman's expression appears solemn, and her gaze drifts off into the distance, almost past the viewer. Her right hand rests on the wood while her left drapes over her knee, which is crossed over her other leg. Her clothes are patterned along the seams. Her shirt opens up slightly as she leans back against a striped wallpaper. In the foreground of the work, her left foot rests on a patterned rug with floral designs. A small box is placed next to a bowl of fruit in the bottom left corner of the work; both items rest on the patterned rug. The lithograph markings bleed into the edges, leaving blank space between Odalisque Assise and its frame."

    "description": "This black and white lithograph depicts the end of a boxing match. The eyes are immediately drawn to the boxer on the floor of the boxing ring. He lays tucked in a fetal position, one hand covering his face and the other stretched out, alluding to being knocked out moments prior. The referee kneels right behind him with his left hand hovering over the boxer's back and his right hand directly above his own head, holding up two fingers to indicate his countdown to ending the match. The winner stands in his corner on the right side of the work, looking down at his unconscious opponent with an expression filled with exhaustion. Next to the victorious boxer stands a shadowy figure, whose only discernible feature is his large, muscular size. Another man from outside the ring is reaching from behind the ropes on the left side of the work, while the crowd in the middle ground of the image remain loosely depicted and unrecognizable."

    "description": "On the lower left of the painting is a hill dotted with trees of various autumn shades of red and yellow. A copse of green Asian pines rest atop the hill, and around it winds a road on which two men of the gentry are riding astride donkeys. Water fills the middle ground, winding up to the background, where faint blue imprints of mountains float above the horizon. Two small sailboats are passing by the center of the water. On the left are two figures, crossing a little bridge that leads to a group of straw-roofed houses. This village is clustered near the base of the large mountains looming on the upper left, also dotted with the red of fall leaves. A seal and inscription of the artist, and a poetic couplet describing the scene, are placed in the upper right corner. The whole painting is framed by an inch-wide, emerald green, patterned silk."

    "description": "This image is that of a pole vaulter in motion.The print shows a male athlete, dressed in a red sleeveless shirt with white shorts, in every phase of the pole vault superimposed on one image. In other words, it shows him running up for the vault, in mid air with the pole bending at almost a 90 degree angle, almost upside down after being launched, and finally, curled over the height bar. Two judges in white suits stand in the foreground, holding up a wooden ladder, features somewhat blurred due to their motion during the capture of the full vault cycle. In the midground there are two more blurred figures wearing suits, standing behind the wooden platform for vaulting, looking upon the athlete. The background shows the dimly-lit indoor stadium with two tall levels of bleachers and a fully packed crowd of onlookers."

    "description": "This black and white photograph centers on a group of men on a grassy field. The men all wear light-colored button-down work prison uniforms, some with matching brimmed hats. Long, full sacks are strewn around on the grass, while some of the men have slung the sacks around their shoulders. Most of the men are standing, excluding one person in the center of the photograph, who is seated on the ground. Those who are standing have one or both of their arms on their waists. All of the men are facing the left side of the photograph, looking at something in the distance. The perspective of the camera is angled so that the man standing at the front of the group is depicted as the largest while the men behind him grow progressively smaller. In the background, the horizon line halves the photograph, the top half showing a blank white sky and the bottom half, darker grass."

    "description": "A dark-skinned woman in a pink checkered dress stands at the center, a straw hat covering her chin-length hair, and green bangles on each wrist. Her right hand is raised into a wave while her left hand is holding up a basket of bright red fruit to her waist. Behind the woman, we see greenery in the background, as well as a grey building with a red chimney in the distance and, closer to the woman, a red structure behind a grey fence. A white bird sits on a patch of greenery facing the woman. In front of her, various plants--including flowers and grasses in various shades of red and green, respectively--line the ground."

    "description": "A woman leans through an orange window frame. The top of her head holds up the bottom edge of the green curtain that hangs over the top half of the window. She wears a small hat that perches on her dark hair, a long-sleeved orange blouse, and a leather jacket hanging over her left shoulder. Her eyes appear to be closed or unfocused. Her hands are crossed over each other, left over right, and her skin has a greenish tint to it. In the background, high yellow grasses and mountains rest against a gray sky. The color palate of this painting is various shades of green, orange, yellow, and grey."

    "description": "The painting is divided into three distinct vertical sections. The central section depicts a seated Chinese woman wearing a patterned green robe against an orange background. In the left and right sections, black Chinese characters in classical forms are written from top to bottom against a vivid red background. The woman in the central section has a pale complexion and dark hair, and her hands are on her lap. There are a number of branches with red and white flowers in front of her, and on one of them, a bird with a light orange body and black wings is perched. Notably, a reddish-brown circle is on the left of the woman's face and two red circles on the right of her lap."

    "description": "This photograph features an Arab woman looking to the right in front of a wall, with her legs extended sideways to the left. Her right arm is mounted on two pillows for support, and her other hand rests in her lap. Her long curly black hair is gathered in a headband in front of her left shoulder. Her pose refers to Edouard Manet's Olympia, a renowned nude portrait. She is wearing traditional Moroccan clothing, a Jabadoor, closely resembling a collared long-sleeved dress with pants. The fabric of her garments, the pillows, and the backdrop are white and decorated with Moroccan calligraphy written Henna, an orange-brown paste from a henna tree used to decorate the body in many Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures. Her visible skin, including her face, hands, and legs from calf down, is patterned with the same henna calligraphy."
