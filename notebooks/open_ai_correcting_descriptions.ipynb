The face is rendered predominantly in shades of black and gray and painted in small blotches as a stitched quilt would be sewn together. The eyes are dark with white highlights, set beneath what looks like eyebrows created by darker patches. The darker areas define the nose, mouth, and facial structure, while lighter areas highlight portions of the forehead, cheeks, and chin. The image is set against a light tan or beige background. At the bottom edge, there's a burgundy or reddish-brown color that might represent clothing below the neck. A vertical line is running down the center of the image, suggesting a folded page.\"\n",
